# Overview of work I did:
* Spent about 3 to 3.5 hours learning Z3 and applying the constraints from the first example we went over in class (true => I[-50/x], etc.) but couldn't get Z3 to solve it without Z3 looping indefinitely.
* Spent a little under 2 hours working on constraint generation in Racket given an Sexpr that represents some basic code control flow
